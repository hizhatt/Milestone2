What is done:
- Add new item

NOTE: 
\n-> main.cpp IS inventory.cpp. I just like the name 'main' better. Will change during submission.
\n-> to compile and run:
    \n1. Run Command Prompt or Terminal (macOS)
    \n2. Compile the two .cpp file together. 
        \nEg: g++ main.cpp storeitem.cpp
    \n3. Run the .exe or .out(macOS) file
    \n4. Profit ????
