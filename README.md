# Milestone2

It has reached the end. Goodbye.

(Was) NEW:
- Importing file is now complete

What will never be done --is not done--:
- Searching for numbers (with arguments)
- Sorting records

What is done:
- Add new item
- Update data field
- Delete data field
- Delete item(record)
- Show all data
- Search for item with given text (match case)
- Saving/Exporting record to a txt file.
- Importing file

NOTE: 
- main.cpp IS inventory.cpp. I just like the name 'main' better. Will change during submission.
- to compile and run:
    1. Run Command Prompt or Terminal (macOS)
    2. Compile the two .cpp file together. 
        Eg: g++ main.cpp storeitem.cpp
    3. Run the .exe or .out(macOS) file
    4. Profit ????
